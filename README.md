# Getting Started with GatorPages

This project's goal is to comprehend the grasp of how efficient large platform web search applications (Google.com, Yahoo.com, Bing.com) execute search with great speed. And also how important the design and implementaion of algorithms are. We display this by doing a BFS (Bredth Firsdt Search) and DFS (Depth First Search) to see how an algorithm can significantly affect the speed of a program.

## initial setup
cd ./GatorPager

`npm install`

To install nodes dependencies and libraries.

cd ./frontend

Again `npm install` to install reacts dependencies and libraries.\
After completing initial steps, all depedencies and libraries should be installed.\

# Running GatorPages
### Open new terminal.
Start express server: In "./GatorPager" run `node app.js`.

### In new terminal tab.
Start react app: In "./GatorPager/frontend/src" run 'npm start.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### Open additional terminal tab
Start python script for searching:  In "./GatorPager/frontend/src" run `python3 graph.py` 



### Done.
Enter any keyword for searching and wait for results. Results will be rendered in [http:localhost:300].

# Note
**To view BFS and DFS implementatin go to frontend/src/graph.py**

# Q&A
### How long should searching take? 
It depends on where the node is positioned in the adjancy list. 
Nodes closer to  to the beginning will run faster than latter nodes.

### Can you contribute?
Yes, please get in contact with the repo's owners for further instructions and guidelines.

### How to add a new data set?
Simply update the data.csv with the new data

### Where to learn more about the performance and devolopment proccess.
Please refer to the analysis.pdf in ./GatorPager
